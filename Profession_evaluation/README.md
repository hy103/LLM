The aim of the project is t0 evaluate a Person's profession based on years of experience, level of innovation, organization reputation etc.
I have first outlined the features which are most considered while evaluating a candiadate capability for a particular job.

As the features cannot be measeured absolutely. I have incorporated the fuzzy logic to handle imprecise and uncertain information, providing a more nuanced approach. Fuzzy logic helps with the concepts that are inherently ambiguous or subjective, like "good quality," "high demand," or "customer satisfaction."

I have curated the features and assigned weights according to person's evaluation for a higher posiiton like CEO.

These are the features and its weights based on the importance of feature

1. Years of work experience - 0.13 (assuming high importance)
2. Educational Qualifications - 0.08 (assuming lower importance than experience)
3. Skillset (relevant) -  0.12 (assuming high importance)
4. Education institutes - 0.07 (assuming moderate importance)
5. Job title - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
6. Previous company reputation or ranking - 0.08 (assuming moderate importance)
7. Level of innovation and technology advancement - 0.11 (assuming moderate importance)
8. Person's dependency on projects/product - 0.10 (assuming moderate importance)
9. Number of successful projects - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
10. Size of the teams handled - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
11. Revenue generated to the projects - 0.06 (assuming lower importance)


I have used the triangular fuzzy membership functions as they are simple and easily capture the linear relationships in between features.
Triangular fuzzy membership functions resemble a triangle, flat at the bottom and linearly increasing/decreasing towards a peak. Left base point of the triangle, peak point of the triangle and right base point of the triangle.

Coming to the feature processing, i have scaled all features except "Years of Experience," to a scale of 0 to 1. The scale for "Years of Experience" is maintained in its original numerical range.

Defined triangular membership functions, categorizing them into 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high' based on their respective importance for each fearture.

I have written the fuzzy rules(in this case only 3 but can be extended) to capture the evaluation criteria. The rules are created considering the importance of each feature and the membership of their values in the defined fuzzy sets.

A control system is established with the defined fuzzy rules.The ControlSystemSimulation is employed to simulate the control system, allowing for the calculation of the final professional value.

Used scikit-fuzzy library for fuzzy logic operations.Features are normalized and assigned fuzzy sets based on the defined membership functions.

The calculate_professional_value function takes feature values and weights, applies normalization and weights, and computes the final professional value.

Note : I have taken the example weights and features and designed the fuzzy rules for a higher position. We can change the rules and the feature weights according to the evaluation criteria.
