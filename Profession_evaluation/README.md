The aim of the project is the evaluate a Person's profession based on years of experience, level of innovation, organization reputation etc.
I have first outlined the features which are most considered while evaluating a candiadate capability for a particular job.

As the features cannot be measeured absolutely. I have incorporated the fuzzy logic to handle imprecise and uncertain information, providing a more nuanced approach. Fuzzy logic helps with the concepts that are inherently ambiguous or subjective, like "good quality," "high demand," or "customer satisfaction."

I have curated the features and assigned weights according to person's evaluation for a CEO position.

These are the features.
Feature and its weights based on the importance of feature

1. Years of work experience - 0.13 (assuming high importance)
2. Educational Qualifications - 0.08 (assuming lower importance than experience)
3. Skillset (relevant) -  0.12 (assuming high importance)
4. Education institutes - 0.07 (assuming moderate importance)
5. Job title - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
6. Previous company reputation or ranking - 0.08 (assuming moderate importance)
7. Level of innovation and technology advancement - 0.11 (assuming moderate importance)
8. Person's dependency on projects/product - 0.10 (assuming moderate importance)
9. Number of successful projects - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
10. Size of the teams handled - 0.09 (assuming moderate importance)
11. Revenue generated to the projects - 0.06 (assuming lower importance)
