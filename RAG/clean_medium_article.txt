As of Feb 2025, the landscape of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved significantly. Below is an updated list of the top 11 open-source LLMs, including their release dates, parameter sizes, and primary use cases:

Lets Understand Open Models vs. Open-Source Language Models

Language models can be categorized into three types: proprietary, open models (or open weights), and open-source models. Proprietary models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, are only accessible through paid APIs or web interfaces. Open models, like Meta’s Llama 2 or Mistral’s Mixtral 8x7B, have their model architectures and weights openly available on the internet. Finally, open-source models like OLMo by AI2 provide complete pre-training data, training code, evaluation code, and model weights, enabling academics and researchers to re-create and analyze the model in depth.

Introduction to Open-Source LLMs

Open-source LLMs are freely available models trained on vast datasets. These models allow customization and scalability for diverse applications, ranging from content generation to conversational AI.
